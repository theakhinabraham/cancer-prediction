## Objective of the Project:

The aim of this machine learning project is to simulate a medical diagnosis scenario for educational purposes. We will assist healthcare professionals in making informed decisions by predicting whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on patient data. Although the data used in this project is real-world data sourced from Kaggle, it is intended solely for learning, and the insights gained will guide us in providing accurate and reliable predictions using a machine learning model.

I got the data from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data/">Kaggle</a>
    <br /> <br>


## Data Description:

For this project, we utilized a dataset sourced from Kaggle, which contains various metrics about patients diagnosed with tumors. The dataset includes:

<li>Radius Mean: The average radius of the tumor cells.</li>
<li>Texture Mean: The standard deviation of gray-scale values of the tumor.</li>
<li>Perimeter Mean: The mean size of the tumor perimeter.</li>
<li>Area Mean: The mean size of the tumor area.</li>
<li>Smoothness Mean: The mean smoothness of the tumor surface.</li>
<li>Compactness Mean: The mean compactness of the tumor.</li>
<li>Concavity Mean: The mean concavity of the tumor.</li>
<li>Concave Points Mean: The mean number of concave points on the tumor surface.</li>
<li>Symmetry Mean: The mean symmetry of the tumor.</li>
<li>Fractal Dimension Mean: The mean fractal dimension of the tumor.</li>
<br /> <br>

Please note that while the dataset represents actual patient data, it has been anonymized for the purpose of this educational project.
<br /> <br>
## Evaluation

In evaluating the performance of our machine learning model, which was built to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign, we obtained the following metrics:

<li>Accuracy: 0.98</li>
<li>Precision: 0.99 (for benign) / 0.97 (for malignant)</li>
<li>Recall: 0.98</li>
<br>

The accuracy of the model indicates that 98% of the predictions made by the model are correct. The precision score reflects the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions, with 99% precision for benign tumors and 97% for malignant tumors. The recall score, on the other hand, measures the model's ability to correctly identify true positive cases, with a recall of 98%. These metrics collectively demonstrate the high accuracy and reliability of the model in predicting tumor malignancy, making it a valuable tool for aiding healthcare professionals in decision-making.
